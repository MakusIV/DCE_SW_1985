CHANGELOG

19 May 2023
- New file names: delete the old kneeboards to avoid having duplicates.
- All pages overhauled with a more consistent and easy-to-read design.
- Normandy 2.0 added.
- Inverted night mode added.
- Runway lengths added.
- Magvar data added to every page (more accurate and useful than the previous "true to mag" numbers).
- All magnetic headings re-measured for 2023 (modern maps) and 1944 (WWII maps).
- Added a group of pages with the true runway headings and internal airbase IDs (thanks to cfrag, Grimes, and Kanelbolle).
- Marked the primary runways at aerodromes that have more than one.
- Added remarks and graphics to denote dangerous approaches, obstacles, and runway conditions.
- Persian Gulf: Quasoura aerodrome added.
- Normandy 1944 removed from the PDFs and will soon be removed from the download.
- Russian-language Caucasus kneeboards removed.

DESCRIPTION

This collection of kneeboards contains comprehensive info on every aerodrome in DCS.

All ATC frequencies and beacons (TACAN, VOR, NDB, ILS, RSBN, PRMG), GPS coordinates, elevations, magnetic and true runway headings, navigational (Su-25T) and internal (getAirbases) IDs, magnetic declination — you name it.

Available in table and map formats (both in the day and night variants) for every DCS map: Normandy 2.0, South Atlantic, Marianas, Syria, Persian Gulf, Caucasus, Nevada, and The Channel.

The GPS coordinates are provided in a hybrid format that combines Seconds (used by the Tomcat and Harrier, among others) and Decimal Minutes (used by the Apache, Viper, Warthog, Hornet, and other modules). It looks like this: N12°34'56/.789, and splits into N12°34'56" and N12°34.789'
